# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets-
Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets, for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, with the help of data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.  Considering, the company only build apps that are free to download and install, and their main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. That means that their revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use their app.   Our goal for this project is to analyze data to understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
